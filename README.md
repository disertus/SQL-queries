### SQL dialect:
Since Iâ€™ve worked with Google MySQL (5.1) DB for quite some time, I decided to choose this dialect because of its familiarity.

Due to the lack of a straightforward way to calculate the group median in MySQL 5.1 dialect, the code in query3 turned out to be a bit lengthy (there are better ways to do it in Postgre)

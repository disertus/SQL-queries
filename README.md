### SQL dialect:
Since Iâ€™ve worked with Google MySQL (5.1) DB for quite some time, I decided to choose this dialect because of its familiarity.

#### Note:
Due to the lack of a straightforward way to calculate the group median in MySQL 5.7 dialect, the code in query2 turned out to be a bit lengthy (apparently there are more elegant ways to do it in Postgre)
